## About Me  🌱
I am interested in software engineering and IT. I spend most of my time building things for the web, but I also enjoy learning about networking and operating systems.

Outside of tech, I love making art and getting lost in a good book. My main focus is front-end web development, but I’m always curious about how things work behind the scenes.
